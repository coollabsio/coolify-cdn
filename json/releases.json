You can allow anyone to be able to do this in the Advanced settings (if you have pull requests enabled).\r\n- fix(ui): Wrong link in email settings page.\r\n- fix(api): Regenerate labels if domain changed through the API.\r\n- fix(changelogs): Instances fetch Github Releases from our custom CDN to prevent Github rate limit.\r\n- fix(service-outline): update SECRET_KEY environment variable in getoutline.yaml to use SERVICE_HEX_32_OUTLINE\r\n- fix(core): ownership issues with some docker-compose file based deployments.\r\n- fix(proxy): Proxy configuration randomly resets to default. Now it is not.\r\n- fix(volumes): Database volumes could not be updated (was readonly).\r\n- fix(cloning): Cloning with PR deployments are now fixed.\r\n- refactor(db): Cleanup unused models/tables.\r\n\r\n# Issues\r\n- fix #6281\r\n- fix #6546\r\n- fix #5156\r\n- fix #6495\r\n- fix #6216\r\n- fix #5747\r\n- fix #6520\r\n- fix #3079\r\n- fix #4976\r\n\r\n## What's Changed\r\n* fix(ui): transactional email settings link on members page by @blazingh in https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/pull/6491\r\n* fix: appwrite template - 500 errors, missing env vars etc. by @ChiragAgg5k in https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/pull/6510\r\n* chore(deps-dev): bump vite from 6.3.5 to 6.3.6 by @dependabot[bot] in https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/pull/6577\r\n* Add SERVICE_NAME variable for docker compose services by @Arnaud-IFEA in https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/pull/6170\r\n* v4.0.0-beta.427 by @andrasbacsai in https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/pull/6507\r\n\r\n## New Contributors\r\n* @blazingh made their first contribution in https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/pull/6491\r\n* @ChiragAgg5k made their first contribution in https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/pull/6510\r\n* @Arnaud-IFEA made their first contribution in https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/pull/6170\r\n\r\n**Full Changelog**: https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/compare/v4.0.0-beta.426...v4.0.0-beta.427",

        "body": "Today\u2019s release introduces shallow git cloning for improved git cloning performance. It also includes the ability to set a timeout on backup jobs so that massive databases are backed up properly. Additionally, this release brings CPU and RAM usage improvements backported from v5. Also it fixes a long-outstanding issue where the magic ENV variables FQDN and URL were switched up.\r\n\r\n**This release also includes several critical bug and security fixes. It is recommended that you update as soon as possible.**\r\n\r\n## Changes\r\n\r\n- feat(git): Allow shallow cloning by default (`depth=1`), which improves the git cloning process speed by a LOT.\r\n- feat(ACL): (Not activated yet) Members from now on should not able to change stuffs around Coolify. They can only view things as it should be from day 1.\r\n- feat(backups): added the ability to set a backup job `timeout` in seconds. This was needed as large backups can take much longer to complete, so users should be able to set the `timeout` themselves\r\n- feat(backups): Able to delete local backups if S3 is enabled, so it preserve space on the server.\r\n- feat(nixpacks): enable support for bun 1.2\r\n- feat(queues): improve Horizon config to reduce CPU and RAM usage\r\n  - `maxTime` and `maxJobs` ensure that each worker is stopped (and immediately started again by `s6-overlay`, as they are long-running) after either 400 jobs or 1 hour has passed. This helps free up accumulated Memory and CPU. Previously, we were not restarting workers at all, which caused some to consume far more CPU and Memory than they should have (`memory` was already limited though). Users mentioned that rebooting the server fixed this issue https://github.com/coollabsio/coolify/issues/2110#issuecomment-3057768791, which makes sense because rebooting restarts the workers as a side effect of Docker restarting the `coolify` container. Now this is no longer needed and is handled automatically.\r\n  - `sleep` -> when a worker is idle, it now waits 3 seconds before polling again, which helps reduce small CPU spikes.\r\n  - `balance` is now set to `false` by default. This allows us to strictly prioritize `high` queued jobs over `default` queued jobs. Previously, we used `auto` which simply assigned workers to the queue with the most jobs (by `size` - `autoScalingStrategy`). Which by default in most cases will be the `default` queue which is not ideal as then `default` jobs will be process before `high` jobs.\r\n  - `balance` set to `false` also reduces idle running workers form 2 workers to 1 worker\r\n  - After a lot of testing and I think most users run Coolify on a 2-core server. We should reduce the default maxProcesses` to 4, as having more workers than 2x the number of CPU cores does not help and only causes higher CPU load during job runs.\r\n- feat(api): add API endpoints for managing environments\r\n- feat(changelog): add changelog to the coolify UI\r\n- feat(changelog): implement automated changelog fetching from GitHub \r\n- feat(changelog): add read tracking and unread count to changelog\r\n- feat(scheduling): introduce ScheduledJobManager and ServerResourceManager for enhanced job scheduling and resource management\r\n- feat(backup): add disable local backup option\r\n- feat(deployment): add pull request filtering and pagination to deployment and backup execution components\r\n- feat(email): implement email change request and verification process\r\n- feat(service): enable password protection for the Wireguard service\r\n- feat(horizon): update queue configuration to use environment variable for dynamic queue management\r\n- feat(ui): add frequency filter option for manual execution of scheduled jobs\r\n- feat(templates): add a `category` to all services, for the docs service filter\r\n- feat(code): Add Mr. Jean-Claude markdown file.\r\n- feat(previews): implement soft delete and cleanup for ApplicationPreview, enhancing resource management in DeleteResourceJob\r\n- feat(lang): add Polish language & improve `forgot_password` translation\r\n- fix(backups): backup execution can be stuck in `In Progress`\r\n- fix(backups): If the backup job fails because the `timeout`  is hit there will now be an error shown in the UI.\r\n- fix(backups): Backups sometimes fail when the database is larger than 40GB\r\n- fix(storage): ensure that stopping a database or any other container with volumes, when the server setting `Delete Unused Volumes` is enabled, does not cause the database or container to lose its volume data\r\n- fix(compose): FQDN and URL variables are no longer switched up for new services and applications\r\n- fix(services): switch FQDN and URL variables in all services\r\n- fix(docker): docker cleanup always running on deletion instead of using the deletion modal settings\r\n- fix(database): custom postgres config with SSL enabled would not be used\r\n- fix(docker): ENVs in volume names are not working working\r\n- fix(git): use exact refspec in ls-remote to avoid matching similarly named branches\r\n- fix(proxy): filter host network from default proxy\r\n- fix(application): streamline environment variable updates for Docker\r\n- fix(proxy): remove hardcoded port 80/443 checks \r\n-

options\r\n- fix(ui): add various UI improvements like input autofocus...\r\n- fix(ui): Delete button width on small screens\r\n- fix(ui): handle null values in postgres metrics\r\n- fix(ui): search box overlaps the sidebar navigation on table sized screens\r\n- fix(ui): typo on proxy request handler tooltip\r\n- fix(ui): add flex-wrap to prevent overflow on small screens\r\n- refactor(docker): improve the Docker cleanup action by adding two new arguments `deleteUnusedVolumes` and `deleteUnusedNetworks`, so that volumes and networks are deleted only when explicitly requested  \r\n- refactor(links): replace inline SVGs with reusable external link component\r\n- refactor(previews): move preview domain generation logic to ApplicationPreview model for better encapsulation and consistency across webhook handlers\r\n- chore(deps): update all dependencies to the latest version\r\n- chore(deletion): rename `isDeleteOperation` to `deleteConnectedNetworks`\r\n- chore(cleanup):
